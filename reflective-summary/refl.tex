The Computer Security class covered 8 big topics:
the Introduction,
Steganography,
Cryptography,
Access Control,
Network Security,
Kerberos,
Web Security and
Social Engineering.

The Introduction describes the context in which Computer Security became
a major concern and that was when legal systems throughout the world
recognized the common threats in information systems (hackers, spies etc.)
and identified the various motivation behind them, notably money, revenge
and bragging. Laws like ``The Computer Misuse Act (1990)'', the amendments
in the ``Serious Crime Act (2015)'' and the recent``GDPR'' were introduced
to penalize entities that attempt to break the
Confidentiality, the Integrity or the Availability (CIA triad) of information
and resources. One important lesson I learned from the Introduction is
about the existence of the Risk Matrix which tells how dangerous
a cyber attack is
according to the impact it produces on a system and the likelihood of
it happening. It also became clear to me that the next 7 topics arose
from the need of ensuring
the CIA triad of digital data.
